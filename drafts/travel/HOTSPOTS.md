## Fixes from this QA pass

- Running heads on the first page of a book still showed the previous book (`MALACHI · 4` on Matthew, `JOHN · 21` on Acts, etc.). Headers now query a per-page `<run-head>` mark.
- Psalm 119 `\qa א` rendered as a missing-glyph box in the OFL stand-in. Hebrew-only acrostic lines are omitted; the Latin `ALEPH` / `BETH` labels remain.
- Translator-note letters ran into three-character markers (`cdh`, `gdp`) across the canon. The footnote counter now resets **on every page** (header) and still at each book pagebreak.

## Checks

| Check | Page | Result | Notes |

## Footnote numbering (2026-09-02)

Letter markers reset at the start of each page via `counter(footnote).update(0)`
in the Typst page header (the documented Typst pattern). Book pagebreaks still
reset as a safety net.

John-only recompile (`--grid-proof --book John`, 49 pages): every sampled
footnote listing starts at `a`. Page 2 carries notes **a–f**; page 3 starts
again at **a**. No two-letter markers in the 49-page John PDF.

Psalms-only targeted compile (`--book Psalms`, 197 pages): same reset. Page 2
has **a–e**; page 3 starts at **a**. Zero two-letter markers across the book.

Do not treat two-letter markers inside a single page as a regression unless
that page has more than 26 notes.

## Known leftovers (not chased)

- Loved-face Milo compile is unchanged and still fail-closed without `fonts/milo/`.
- Typst can fail to converge if a footnote sits exactly at a page break when the counter resets (upstream issue). If a compile warns, re-check that page; do not widen the page spec to paper over it.
